# brute-force-vs-simulated-annealing-metropolis-algorithm
This algorithm compares the shortest path calculated from either

    1. Brute force method: calculating all the possible path and find out the 
       minimum path, or 
    2. Simulated annealing and the metropolis algorithm(SAMA).
    
The randonly generated sites are listed in rr.csv

NN is a number that is larger than 3 and smaller than N=25

Version V0_1: 

    1. Change the program to loops and calculate the possible NNs automatically
    2. Add function definition def cpu_stats() to keep track of RAM usage.
